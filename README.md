# Math Concepts in Code

This repository is dedicated to implementing various mathematical concepts learned in my Math Classes. It serves as a way to explore and visualize different areas of mathematics using Python, and aims to make abstract mathematical ideas more tangible.

### Motivation

This project was inspired by my math classes.

### Current Concepts Explored
- **2D Vectors**: Implementations of vector arithmetic, dot products, and cross products in 2D.
- **Geometry**: Drawing shapes, lines, and points using pixel manipulation Bresenham's Line Algorithm.

### Future Concepts
This repository will continue to grow as I explore new mathematical topics and implement them in code. Future areas might include:
- 3D vectors and transformations
- Statistics
- Advanced linear algebra (e.g., eigenvalues/eigenvectors)
- Probability and statistics simulations
- Numerical methods and algorithms
- Machine learning foundations
-  Linear Algebra: Basic matrix operations, transformations, and visualizations.
- Calculus: Approximations and visualizations of derivatives and integrals.
- Graphs: Visualization and traversal of mathematical graphs (nodes and edges).
