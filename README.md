# Math Concepts in Code

This repository is dedicated to implementing various mathematical concepts learned through my studies into code. It serves as a way to explore and visualize different areas of mathematics using Python, and aims to make abstract mathematical ideas more tangible and interactive through programming.

### Motivation

This project was inspired by my math classes and the desire to bridge the gap between theory and practice. By writing code to implement these concepts, I not only gain a deeper understanding of the math but also improve my coding skills. Each implementation serves as a hands-on approach to better grasp the underlying mathematical principles.

### Current Concepts Explored
- **2D Vectors**: Implementations of vector arithmetic, dot products, and cross products in 2D.
- **Geometry**: Drawing shapes, lines, and points using pixel manipulation and algorithms like Bresenham's Line Algorithm.

### Future Concepts
This repository will continue to grow as I explore new mathematical topics and implement them in code. Future areas might include:
- 3D vectors and transformations
- Statistics
- Advanced linear algebra (e.g., eigenvalues/eigenvectors)
- Probability and statistics simulations
- Numerical methods and algorithms
- Machine learning foundations
-  Linear Algebra: Basic matrix operations, transformations, and visualizations.
- Calculus: Approximations and visualizations of derivatives and integrals.
- Graphs: Visualization and traversal of mathematical graphs (nodes and edges).
